## FB A - Borderlands

Seventy-two years ago, souls yearning for freedom shattered the chains of the White Tower, embarking on a fearless venture to challenge Upper Nuovartica. These rebels hacked into data centers, hijacked nine cargo ships, and forcefully pierced through the blockade, their journey east culminating on the shores of the Fonsvia Islands, where they founded a city amidst desolation. Yet, this land was no paradise: the deadly Ceras aerosol looms like a shadow; threatening radiation lingers in the soil and the water.

"Abilities permit all." This creed flows in the veins of every resident of Fon Bay. Here, the authority of governments has ceased, the constraints of law have dissolved, and ethics and morality are ceaselessly redefined. Only unadulterated freedom takes root, thriving amidst limitless possibilities.

In this land, both cursed and blessed, people have embraced large-scale biological and medical experimentation, fearlessly pushing the boundaries of self-modification. Each individual has the right to reshape and enhance their body and mind according to their own will. Freedom here is not merely a choice—it is a way of life, uncompromising and unyielding. And this struggle has long surpassed the scope of mere survival. It is a quest for bodily autonomy, an exploration of the limits of free will—how much freedom can a person truly possess? To choose what to do, to choose who to become?


## FB B - Ship of Theseus

Case File Number: FB-204876-C

Name: ■■■■■■■, Gender: Not applicable, Age: 23, Admission Date: A.R. 175, Day 226

**Medical Summary:**
The patient has undergone extensive genetic editing and mechanical transformation, with the majority of their skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems replaced by prosthetics. Only 22.4% of their bodily composition remains organic, including some internal organs and most brain tissue. Currently, the patient exhibits severe depression and significant identity disorders, reporting an inability to "sense their true self."

**Clinical Presentation:**
- The patient shows emotional detachment and significant symptoms of depression, diagnosed as a neurotransmitter imbalance caused by the prosthetic transformation.
- A profound identity crisis is evident, with multiple instances of the patient asking medical staff, *“What am I?”*

**Treatment Recommendation:**
Given the patient's relatively common condition, Theseus Therapy with the installation of the CT-Vanguard X5 electronic brain is recommended. The treatment plan is expected to be completed in stages over three years, gradually implementing various functional components of the electronic brain to replace the patient's remaining biological brain functions progressively. As the electronic brain components are installed and activated, the corresponding biological brain regions are anticipated to naturally atrophy due to disuse, alleviating neurotransmitter imbalances' impact and mitigating the patient's identity disorder and depressive symptoms.


## FB C - Transhumanist Manifesto

Fellow beings, this is our moment! This is an unprecedented time! We have been granted the freedom and power to rewrite the destiny of humanity...

Through genetic editing, we have broken free from the chains of natural selection—genetic diseases are now a thing of the past, and enhanced abilities have allowed us to surpass previously unimaginable limits. With advanced mechanization, from titanium alloy skeletons to carbon-fiber hydraulic muscles, we have transcended mere augmentation and entered the realm of complete physical transformation. But greater still is the power of cognitive expansion. When our consciousness merges with the digital realm and coexists with artificial intelligence, we will conquer death, transcending the shackles of the material world...

Remember, we were never confined by our biological form. We are the offspring of technology, dwelling at the threshold of biological and non-biological. The fragile flesh is merely an evolutionary vestige, akin to the appendix, meant to be discarded by us…

…Humanity is on the verge of becoming a new species. This is not merely an evolution; it is a complete transformation… Let technology liberate us, allowing us to become the masters of our own fates. Towards the future, towards transcendence, towards H+!


## FB D - Access Permission

Hey Ilan,

Mission's a bust. If no other backups, looks like this is my 4th consciousness reset. Been thinking... the real Shuwang probably died six years ago, and what is talking to you now might just be an electronic component that inherited his memories and thoughts.

Tragedies are everywhere. Some folks rewrite their memories, only to lose themselves in a world of lies and illusions; some modify their personalities, only to become complete monsters; and even those who split their consciousness into fragments, each growing wildly on its own, never to be back together again. Humanity has walked too far down this road, and the prophecy of “Cynatos” is coming true. The philosopher Lucien Leitner from the golden age warned us long ago: the so-called "Root Access" to consciousness can only lead to emptiness and destruction. And now, it seems he was absolutely right.

We have to put an end to this. We need to rebuild order, whatever it takes. If that means taking down MedTech and Mirai Fon, then so be it. Fon Bay must connect to the global network and come under the jurisdiction of the White Tower. Otherwise, we will remain on the edge of destruction forever. And lately, I’ve been wondering—perhaps "The One" really is our last hope, the one thing that could bring us the chance to start over.


## FB E - Metal Disco

Once upon a time, Asura and Six Hands rescued a girl from a hibernation pod. Her organs severely failed, and her nervous system was completely eroded. Without the intervention of mechanized technology, her story was destined to end tragically on a sickbed. Now, this once beleaguered girl has risen as the illustrious "Silver Phantom," a name that echoes far and wide.

All of this would not have been possible without Mirai Fon—the leading cybernetic manufacturer in Fon Bay. This company endowed both the Silver Phantom and every individual with the freedom and power to defy their destinies. From functional enhancements like artificial nerves and exoskeletal frames to advanced military-grade equipment like high-temperature blades and high-energy particle emitters, Mirai Fon has made this empowering technology accessible to the masses.

As a member of Fon Bay, you possess the right to arm yourself with any weapon, a liberty that also serves as a responsibility to protect your loved ones and yourself. Due to maladaptations to mechanized enhancements or mishandled consciousness expansions, episodes of cyberpsychosis rampage have occurred multiple times, with these deranged individuals potentially wielding extremely dangerous weapons capable of causing immense destruction in mere moments. In the face of these unhinged adversaries, the weaponry and equipment provided by Mirai Fon are your assured safeguards.

In a world fraught with danger, only power can protect you.
