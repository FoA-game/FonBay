## FB A - Borderlands

Seventy-two years ago, souls yearning for freedom shattered the chains of the White Tower, embarking on a fearless venture to challenge Upper Nuovartica. These rebels hacked into data centers, hijacked nine cargo ships, and forcefully pierced through the blockade, their journey east culminating on the shores of the Fonsvia Islands, where they founded a city amidst desolation. Yet, this land was no paradise: the deadly Ceras aerosol looms like a shadow; threatening radiation lingers in the soil and the water.

"Abilities permit all." This creed flows in the veins of every resident of Fon Bay. Here, the authority of governments has ceased, the constraints of law have dissolved, and ethics and morality are ceaselessly redefined. Only unadulterated freedom takes root, thriving amidst limitless possibilities.

In this land, both cursed and blessed, people have embraced large-scale biological and medical experimentation, fearlessly pushing the boundaries of self-modification. Each individual has the right to reshape and enhance their body and mind according to their own will. Freedom here is not merely a choice—it is a way of life, uncompromising and unyielding. And this struggle has long surpassed the scope of mere survival. It is a quest for bodily autonomy, an exploration of the limits of free will—how much freedom can a person truly possess? To choose what to do, to choose who to become?


## FB B - Ship of Theseus

Case File Number: FB-204876-C

Name: ■■■■■■■, Gender: Not applicable, Age: 23, Admission Date: A.R. 175, Day 226

**Medical Summary:**
The patient has undergone extensive genetic editing and mechanical transformation, with the majority of their skeletal, muscular, and nervous systems replaced by prosthetics. Only 22.4% of their bodily composition remains organic, including some internal organs and most brain tissue. Currently, the patient exhibits severe depression and significant identity disorders, reporting an inability to "sense their true self."

**Clinical Presentation:**
-	The patient displays emotional apathy, lack of empathy, and pronounced depressive symptoms.
-	The patient has a severe identity disorder, repeatedly asking medical personnel, "What am I?"
-	The patient demonstrates repetitive behaviors and mild violent tendencies.

**Treatment Recommendation:**
The symptoms have been diagnosed as hormone imbalances caused by extensive prosthetic transformation. Given the prevalence of such cases, it is recommended that intervention be initiated through "Theseus Therapy." This involves the phased installation of the CT-Vanguard X5 Neural Brain over a three-year period. Each functional component of the neural brain will gradually replace the biological brain functions. The unused biological brain sections are anticipated to naturally atrophy over time. This process aims to restore neurotransmitter balance, alleviate identity disorder and depressive symptoms, and ultimately improve the patient's quality of life.

**Special Note:**
During the treatment period, it is advised to restrict the patient's built-in weapon functions to ensure safety.



## FB C - Transhumanist Manifesto

"Listen up, folks, our flesh-and-blood bodies? They're outdated. You all know what it's like to feel the limits of your own body—the pain, the sickness, the roads you can't run, the weights you can't lift, the things you forget, the questions you can't answer. But let me tell you this: you can do so much more now."

"Some people say, ‘This stuff is dangerous.’ Of course, it’s dangerous! Name one thing in this world that isn’t. From the moment you’re born, danger’s your shadow. The real question is: are you willing to trade a little danger for freedom? Are you ready to give up that weak, fragile shell you’re stuck in and step into a version of yourself that never stops upgrading?"

"This is Fon Bay. Danger is the air we breathe. You scared of mental breakdowns? Ceras aerosols? Let me tell you, those things are just filters—they weed out the weak. And we? We’re not weak. Look around you, at the people on the streets. See those mechanical hands, those bionic eyes, those enhanced nerves and brains? Don’t be afraid of them. They’re the reason we’re faster, stronger, smarter."

"I know some of you cling to the past, to this idea of ‘nature.’ But what is nature, really? Nature is what starves you, what sickens you, what ages you to death. Do you want to let nature win? Or do you want to use the power you’ve built with your own hands to break free from its chains?"

"So choose, brothers and sisters: stay trapped in the body and the past, or take that step forward and claim your freedom. Choose evolution. Choose H+. The future is out there. The only question is: do you have the guts to reach for it?"


## FB D - Access Permission

Hey Ilan,

Mission's a bust. If no other backups, looks like this is my 4th consciousness reset. Been thinking... the real Shuwang probably died six years ago, and what is talking to you now might just be an electronic component that inherited his memories and thoughts.

Tragedies are everywhere. Some folks rewrite their memories, only to lose themselves in a world of lies and illusions; some modify their personalities, only to become complete monsters; and even those who split their consciousness into fragments, each growing wildly on its own, never to be back together again. Humanity has walked too far down this road, and the prophecy of “Cynatos” is coming true. The philosopher Lucien Leitner from the golden age warned us long ago: the so-called "Root Access" to consciousness can only lead to emptiness and destruction. And now, it seems he was absolutely right.

We have to put an end to this. We need to rebuild order, whatever it takes. If that means taking down MedTech and Mirai Fon, then so be it. Fon Bay must connect to the global network and come under the jurisdiction of the White Tower. Otherwise, we will remain on the edge of destruction forever. And lately, I’ve been wondering—perhaps "The One" really is our last hope, the one thing that could bring us the chance to start over.


## FB E - Armament Race

Once upon a time, Asura and Six Hands rescued a girl from a hibernation pod. Her organs severely failed, and her nervous system was completely eroded. Without the intervention of mechanized technology, her story was destined to end tragically on a sickbed. Now, this once beleaguered girl has risen as the illustrious "Silver Phantom," a name that echoes far and wide.

All of this would not have been possible without Mirai Fon—the leading cybernetic manufacturer in Fon Bay. This company endowed both the Silver Phantom and every individual with the freedom and power to defy their destinies. From functional enhancements like artificial nerves and exoskeletal frames to advanced military-grade equipment like high-temperature blades and high-energy particle emitters, Mirai Fon has made this empowering technology accessible to the masses.

As a resident of Fon Bay, the right to arm yourself is not just a freedom but also a responsibility—to protect your family and yourself. In this city, danger has never been far away: K.O.S. terrorist attacks, gang wars, and the frequent violent outbreaks of cyberpsychosis patients all underscore the importance of being armed. Last month, an unprecedented street battle swept through an entire district, with the firepower of mechanized combatants reducing once-bustling streets to rubble. In the face of such dangers, only greater strength can ensure your safety. Let Mirai Fon be your trusted safeguard.
